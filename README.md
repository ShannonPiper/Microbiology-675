* CPU executes commands
* Memory/RAM is short term storage for programs being run (not permanent)
* Disk space is long term storage (permanent)
* "High speed" CPU is not really the limitation of computers
  * limitation is how fast information can be given to the CPU, determined by the frontside bus through which information from the  northbridge memory (from RAM) is channeled to the CPU.

## Language:
* We think of numbers to the base 10, computers use base 2.
* Base 2 means something is either on or off (1 or 0).

## Windows, Mac, Unix/Linux
* For Windows, the kernel is stacked with the operating system above it and the program is submitted above that. Kernel is where everything germinates/runs from. Doesn't allow users and programs to access the kernel directly (which was thought that it would be harder to hack/break those computers).
* For Unix/Linux, the kernel is accessed by programs directly. The operating system (O/S) is next to it, not stacked on top.
* Mac moved towards the way Unix/Linux does things.
